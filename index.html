                    <h2>1.4 Project Closure Document</h2>
                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p><strong>Project Info:</strong> My project, Upskilling into cybersecurity, aims to broaden my view of the Cybersecurity field. By improving my knowledge base with key trends in the field and industry knowledge, I can improve my chances of breaking into the field.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Closure type:</strong> Normal closure, all deliverables complete</p>

                        <p><strong>Deliverables Summary:</strong> My project has 5 Deliverables, the first one being research into the industry, learning more about the industry and skills professionals use in that field. The second deliverable is the creation of a cybersecurity focused resume that has been peer reviewed. The third is the acquisition of an entry level cybersecurity exam. The fourth is catching up with my network and ensuring that they are up to date with my skillset. The final deliverable is applying to 5 entry level cybersecurity jobs.</p>

                        <p><strong>Change log:</strong> Changes were made mainly to ensure that the content would be as recent as possible. The website would be updated as deliverables were completed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Risk and issues:</strong> The only issues I had was juggling the assignments of this class with the assignments of my other classes. This had a detrimental effect of the quality of my work for this class.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stakeholder Management:</strong> The stakeholders that I kept informed above all else were the professor and my manager, both of which have a big say in how my project took shape. I kept them informed of developments and asked questions to get a good idea of how to proceed.</p>

                        <p><strong>What went well:</strong> I had a good knowledge base, with both theory and hands on experience making certain milestones (Milestone 3: Certification Exam) easier. This reduced my stress and allowed me to work through the project.</p>

                        <p><strong>What didn't go well:</strong> I struggled with the workload of this class, and the quality of my work suffered as a result.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I would do differently:</strong> I would take different classes to ensure that the workload remained within comfortable levels, as capstone is one of those classes that takes my full attention.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Time management is an important skill to ensure that work is done on time and correctly</p>
                        
                        <p>Certification exams can be daunting, but studying and preparing beforehand can help ease these concerns</p>
                        
                        <p>Certifications are pretty important; several lucrative jobs list specific certifications in order to progress</p>
                        
                        <p>Finding my niche is an important future goal as it will guide my next steps to career success</p>

                        <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Learn more about skills and improve my knowledge base</p>
                        
                        <p>Work to gain the neccessary work experience to apply for more jobs</p>
                        
                        <p>Look for certifications and work for them because it can improve chances of getting a job</p>

                        <p><strong>Formal Signoff:</strong> I signed off of this project on 11/30/25, due to all of the deliverables being concluded as of that day. My manager signed off on the project as of 12/4/25, after I interviewed him about the project and my next steps.</p>

                        <p><strong>Recognition:</strong> I would like to shout out Kevin Chua, my manager for my part time job. Kevin did a great job teaching me about the IT world and gave excellent advice tailored to my circumstances. He also allowed me to work with and meet other IT professionals.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Project retrospective:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>All in all, the project is a success. I was able to learn more about the cybersecurity industry, learning about both the job market and fundamental concepts in the field. In taking the certification exam and applying for jobs, I learned more about my skills and how they actually fit in the industry.</p>

                        <p><strong>What's next:</strong> Going forward, I'm going to work full time and get that resume souped up and ready. I will also start to look into certifications and look into acquiring them.</p>

                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p><strong>PMI Principle Story 1:</strong> A time I demonstrated leadership principles was during this semester, for another class- CIS 4900, or Capstone. My teammates and I were given leave to select roles, and I was given the role of Team Leader, responsible for guiding/leading communication between the team and the professor. I previously learned about how good leaders can make a difference by guiding the team in a way that is effective and productive. To that end, I would work hard in creating an environment that encouraged openess and questioning. I also took steps to guide discussions to be relevant and on topic, preventing the team from wasting time. The results could not be more clear. The team successfully completed the quasi-internship, and our presentation was ranked first by the class.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>PMI Principle Story 2:</strong> A time I had to respond to a team failure was during the Spring Semester of 2025. We were doing a project where one of the deliverables/sections were not in line with the professor's expectations. The team made several safeguards, and this problem was identified before submission (we scheduled a meeting with the professor she could check our work) Right after learning this issue, we immediately set out to resolve the issue, dividing up the work and revising it. As a result, we were able to pass the project and pass the class.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>PMI Principle Story 3:</strong> A time I had to communicate quality standards to my team was during this semester's capstone class. We had a project, a quasi-internship that consists of several phases. We all knew that this would make up the majority of our grade, but we also had other classes. To resolve this issue, the team and I sat down and talked in length about how to approach this internship. We decided on a balanced approach, allowing us to juggle the different responsibilites. THis approach bore fruit, and we were able to complete the presentation without too much disruption to our responsibilites.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>PMI Presentation Story 1:</strong> A time I worked with the concept of system interactions was during this semester. I was taking a cybersecurity certification exam and took several days to study about the different concepts for the exam. These concepts included access controls, security solutions that work together to safeguard assets from threat actors. I learned about these concepts and started to notice them in the workplace. I could see the bigger picture a bit clearer, I could see the reasoning as to why I had to sanitize recycled machines. It made sense to me. With this knowledge, I experienced first hand the concepts of how system interactions play a role in the workplace.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>PMI Presentation Story 2:</strong> A time I had to work with time management was last semester. I had a project and had to juggle that with my part time job. In order to juggle/walk the fine line I made sure to plan ahead for any issues. This included a concentrated effort of listing my schedule by pen on the calendar on my wall. This would help me plan ahead with this information, easy to reach/access. As a resulting of my planning, I was able to complete the project and work in my part time job without suffering in either.</p>
