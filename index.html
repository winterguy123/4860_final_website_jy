                    Lessons learned:
                    -Time management is an important skill to ensure that work is done on time and correctly
                    -Certification exams can be daunting, but studying and preparing beforehand can help ease these concerns
                    -I have the fundamental/groundworks to excelling in the industry, I just need more
                    -Certifications are pretty important; several lucrative jobs list specific certifications in order to progress
                    -Finding my niche is an important future goal as it will guide my next steps to career success
                    
                    Project retropective:
                    All in all, the project is a success. I was able to learn more about the cybersecurity industry, learning about both the
                    job market and fundamental concepts in the field. In taking the certification exam and applying for jobs, I learned more 
                    about my skills and how they actually fit in the industry. </div>

                    <div class="content-box">PMI Principle Story 1: A time I demonstrated leadership principles was during this semester, for another class- CIS 4900, or Capstone.
                    My teammates and I were given leave to select roles, and I was given the role of Team Leader, responsible for guiding/leading communication between the team and
                    the professor. I previously learned about how good leaders can make a difference by guiding the team in a way that is effective and productive. To that end, I 
                    would work hard in creating an environment that encouraged openess and questioning. I also took steps to guide discussions to be relevant and on topic, preventing
                    the team from wasting time. The results could not be more clear. The team successfully completed the quasi-internship, and our presentation was ranked first by the class.
                    PMI Principle Story 2: A time I had to respond to a team failure was during the Spring Semester of 2025. We were doing a project where one of the deliverables/sections
                    were not in line with the professor's expectations. The team made several safeguards, and this problem was identified before submission (we scheduled a meeting with the 
                    professor she could check our work) Right after learning this issue, we immediately set out to resolve the issue, dividing up the work and revising it. As a result, we were
                    able to pass the project and pass the class.
                    PMI Principle Story 3: A time I had to communicate quality standards to my team was during this semester's capstone class. We had a project, a quasi-internship that consists
                    of several phases. We all knew that this would make up the majority of our grade, but we also had other classes. To resolve this issue, the team and I sat down and talked in 
                    length about how to approach this internship. We decided on a balanced approach, allowing us to juggle the different responsibilites. THis approach bore fruit, and we were able
                    to complete the presentation without too much disruption to our responsibilites.
                    PMI Presentation Story 1: A time I worked with the concept of system interactions was during this semester. I was taking a cybersecurity certification exam and took several days to
                    study about the different concepts for the exam. These concepts included access controls, security solutions that work together to safeguard assets from threat actors. I learned about
                    these concepts and started to notice them in the workplace. I could see the bigger picture a bit clearer, I could see the reasoning as to why I had to sanitize recycled machines. It made
                    sense to me. With this knowledge, I experienced first hand the concepts of how system interactions play a role in the workplace.
                    PMI Presentation Story 2: A time I had to work with time management was last semester. I had a project and had to juggle that with my part time job. In order to juggle/walk the fine line 
                    I made sure to plan ahead for any issues. This included a concentrated effort of listing my schedule by pen on the calendar on my wall. This would help me plan ahead with this information, 
                    easy to reach/access. As a resulting of my planning, I was able to complete the project and work in my part time job without suffering in either.
